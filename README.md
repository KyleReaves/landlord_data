# FindYourLandlord Data Cleaning
### Parsing and cleaning publicly available North Jersey property data
This project aims to 
* provide tenants in North Jersey with information on the property ownership of their unit or building.
* Geocode the address in order to be visualized later in MapBoxGL
* Show what other properties are associated with the owner

The data was gathered from publicly available records on the Monmouth County Tax Assesssor's website: 
https://tax1.co.monmouth.nj.us/cgi-bin/prc6.cgi?menu=index&ms_user=monm&passwd=data&district=1301&mode=11
